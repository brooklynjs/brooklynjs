# Submitting A Talk

## Who can submit talks to BrooklynJS?
We welcome & encourage _everyone_ to submit a talk!
Whether you have been writing JavaScript for 20 years or few days, experienced or 1st time speaker*, we want to hear what you are excited about.

_*Our speaker alumni includes Drew Petersen (@KirbySaysHi), Sarah Saltrick Meyer (@meyerini), Byron Hulcher (@hypirlink) & many more who gave their first talk at BrooklynJS, then started speaking at different meetups and conferences. BrooklynJS is very first time speaker friendly!_

## How do I submit a talk?
Visit the our site GitHub repository and [create a new issue](https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/new) using the template. Make sure to pick up to 3 months that work for you!

## What would be a good talk topic?
We accept a variety of technical and non-technical talks and the audience has varying technical backgrounds and interests.

Talks from accepted proposals have focused on, but not limited to:
- Sharing the process and journey of how you created something and what you've learned.
- Achieving empathy in the workplace.
- A dive into a particular technical concept.

Examples of topics that may not get accepted:
- Why x framework is better than y framework.
- How a tool/language/library works.
- Startup or company pitches.

 We've found that the best talks tell a story, we encourage you to get creative! Browse past [accepted talks](https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccepted+is%3Aclosed) to get ideas and inspiration.

## What do speakers get?
- 1 Boroughgramming* ticket (Free) for you to attend.
- 1 regular BrooklynJS ticket ($15) for a guest that you'd like to have watch your talk.
- 10 minutes to present what you are excited about in front of 100 borough-mates.
- Up to $150 in travel assistance if you're a speaker outside of the NYC metro area.

*If you'd like to come co-work with 30 of borough-mates with bottomless coffee and catered lunch, please be our guest! (We start at 10AM at the same space we run BrooklynJS)

## When are speakers chosen?
We usually select speakers two weeks before an event, the day before tickets go on sale.

_*Current employees of sponsors are not selected to speak on the months of their employer's sponsorship._

## Speaker Checklist
### Slides
Because of the seating arrangement, only the top 2/3 of your slide is visible from the back.(It looks like [this](https://twitter.com/anthonyserious/status/545765946645020672).) Please keep that in mind when you are making slides.

If you are live coding or showing your terminal etc, please keep your font size LARGE!

Please bring any adapters if you need special one. We can also bring a portable speaker if you have audio in your demo or presentation. Please let us know in advance. If you have any other needs for your talk, feel free to contact the organizers.

### Setup
Once the event starts, we'll have an intermission with a musical guest between each talk. If you are the next presenter, please come up to the podium at the front to setup for your presentation during the intermission. Presentation order is on the BrooklynJS website.
