# Submitting A Talk

## Who can submit talks to BrooklynJS?
We welcome & encourage _everyone_ to submit a talk!
Whether you have been writing JavaScript for 20 years or few days, an experienced or 1st time speaker, we want to hear what you are excited about.

*Our speaker alumni includes Jenna Zeigen (@zeigenvector), Drew Petersen (@KirbySaysHi), Sarah Saltrick Meyer (@meyerini), Byron Hulcher (@hypirlink) & many more who gave their first talk at BrooklynJS, then started speaking at different meetups and conferences. BrooklynJS is very first time speaker friendly!*

## How do I submit a talk?
If you'd like to submit a talk, visit the BrooklynJS website repository and [create a new issue](https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io/issues/new).

## What would be a good talk topic?
(TBD on workflow)

## What do Speakers get?
- 1 Boroughgramming* ticket (Free) for you to attend.
- 1 regular BrooklynJS ticket ($15) for a guest that you'd like to have watch your talk.
- 10 minutes to present what you are excited about in front of 100 borough-mates.
- Up to $150 in travel assistance if you're a speaker outside of the NYC metro area.

*If you'd like to come co-work with 30 of borough-mates with bottomless coffee and catered lunch, please be our guest! (We start at 10AM at the same space we run BrooklynJS)

Once the event starts, we'll have an intermission with a musical guest between each talk. If you are the next presenter, please come up to the podium at the front to setup for your presentation during the intermission.
